# DBMS_project
#This web app was developed as part of our DBMS submission to make it easier for gardening enthusiasts to track and manage their plants. 
#In addition to tracking, the app provides tailored recommendations for plants that users can grow at home, considering their preferences, available area, and other relevant factors. 
#The platform also features a blog section where horticulture enthusiasts can interact, share knowledge, and learn more about gardening.
